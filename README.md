# SourceCred's Own Cred

This repository contains SourceCred's own cred instance.

Since our tooling for maintaining independent cred instances is still nascent,
the repo was generated (and may be re-generated) by running the following:

```Bash
export sc=path/to/sourcecred/clone/
./update.sh
git add .
git commit -m "Updated cred"
git push
```
