# SourceCred's Own Cred

This repository contains SourceCred's own cred instance.

Since our tooling for maintaining independent cred instances is still nascent, the repo was generated
(and may be re-generated) by running the follow from within a SourceCred clone:

`./scripts/build_static_site.sh --target $PATH_TO_THIS_REPOSITORY/docs  --project @sourcecred`

You'll need to blow away the existing `docs` directory first.
